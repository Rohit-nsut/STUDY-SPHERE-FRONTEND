# STUDY-SPHERE (Frontend)

> **STUDY-SPHERE** — Frontend application

A modern, responsive React frontend for **STUDY-SPHERE**, a course and study management system. This repo contains the UI that interacts with the STUDY-SPHERE backend (Express API) to manage courses, users, assignments, and learning resources.

---

## Features

* User authentication (login / register)
* Role based views (student / instructor / admin)
* Course creation, enrollment and management
* Assignment creation, submission and grading
* Real-time notifications and activity feed (if backend supports WebSocket)
* Responsive design for desktop and mobile
* Search, filters and pagination for courses and resources

---

## Tech Stack

* **Framework:** React (Create React App / Vite — adapt to what you use)
* **State management:** React Context / Redux (describe whichever you used)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS / CSS Modules / Styled Components (replace with your choice)
* **HTTP client:** Axios / fetch
* **Routing:** react-router
* **Build & Tooling:** npm / yarn, ESLint, Prettier

> *This README assumes React + Tailwind + Axios. Update these lines to match your actual stack.*

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v16+ recommended)
* npm or yarn
* Backend API (STUDY-SPHERE backend) running or an accessible API endpoint

### Environment

Create a `.env` file at the project root (example variables):

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
REACT_APP_SENTRY_DSN=
```

> Update the variables to match your backend and third-party services.

### Install

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# or using yarn
yarn install
```

### Run (development)

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or configured port) to view the app.

### Build (production)

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

The production-ready files are generated in the `build/` directory.

---

## Scripts

Typical scripts you might have in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "start": "react-scripts start",
  "build": "react-scripts build",
  "test": "react-scripts test",
  "lint": "eslint src --fix",
  "format": "prettier --write \"src/**/*.{js,jsx,json,css,md}\""
}
```

Adjust the commands if you use Vite or a different setup.

├─ styles/         # Tailwind or global css

└─ App.jsx
```

## Authentication Flow

* Frontend communicates with backend auth endpoints (`/auth/login`, `/auth/register`, `/auth/refresh`).
* JWT stored in `HttpOnly` cookies (recommended) or `localStorage` (less secure).
* Axios interceptors refresh tokens on `401` responses and attach Authorization header.

> Make sure your backend sets CORS and `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` if you use cookies.

---

## Rate Limiting & Resilience

* Frontend respects HTTP `429 Too Many Requests` responses and shows a friendly retry message.
* Exponential backoff on retryable failures helps during spikes.

---

## Testing

* Unit tests with Jest + React Testing Library
* E2E tests with Cypress (optional)

```bash
npm test
# or
yarn test
```

---

## Deployment

Recommended providers:

* **Vercel** or **Netlify** for static frontend hosting
* Connect the GitHub repository and configure environment variables in the platform dashboard

**Deployment steps (Vercel)**

1. Import the repo in Vercel
2. Set `REACT_APP_API_URL` and other envs in project settings
3. Trigger deploy (Vercel will run `npm run build` by default)

---

## Common Gotchas

* CORS: Ensure backend allows requests from the frontend origin and credentials if using cookies.
* Env variables: React requires `REACT_APP_` prefix for client-side environment variables.
* Time zones: Keep timestamps consistent between backend and frontend (prefer ISO 8601 UTC).
